OI Wireless
==========

Transfer photos wirelessly from your Olympus camera to your phone Camera Roll.  From the Camera roll you can share photos forward.

This app requires a camera supporting wireless Olympus image sharing.  Examples of such cameras are OM-D E-M1, PEN E-P5 and Stylus-1.

Currently only JPEG images are supported, no Olympus RAW support.
